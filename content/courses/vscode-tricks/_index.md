## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is for beginners and experienced developers alike. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 

## How do I enroll?

The first 10 videos are *free*, so just give it try. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
