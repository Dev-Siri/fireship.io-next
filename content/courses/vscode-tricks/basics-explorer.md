## Tasks

- Open the File Explorer with `ctrl + b`
- Close a file with `ctrl + w`
- Save a file with `ctrl + s`

## ‚ú® Trick - Collapse Folders

In the file explorer, find the icon to *collapse all folders* and click it. This will save you the tedious task of closing them one-by-one.

## ‚ú® Trick - Show hidden files

VS code excludes certain hidden files from the file explorer by default, like `.git`. To show hidden files, go to settings and type **exclude** to adjust the patterns shown in the explorer.
