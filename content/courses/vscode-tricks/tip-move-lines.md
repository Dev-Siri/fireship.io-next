## ✨ Trick - Fast Cut or Copy

Copy the line of code that you're currently on by hitting `ctrl+c` or `ctrl+x`. It will copy the entire line, no need to highlight it with the mouse. 

## ✨ Trick - Line Movement

Do move a line somewhere nearby, simply use `alt + ← ↑` to move the line.

To copy the same line of code over and over again, use `shift + alt + ← ↑`
