Invest some time practicing editing your code without using the mouse. This is one of the great secrets to coding faster. 

## ✨ Trick - Symbol Search

Open the command palette with `ctrl+p`, then type an `@` symbol to move around the code quickly.

## ✨ Trick - Highlight Lines of Code

Use the `ctrl+l` key to select lines of code quickly. For more precise selections, use `shift + ← ↑ → ↓` to highlight individual characters.
