## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and will challenge you to build an app that delivers high-performance and search engine visibility via server-side rendering. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of web programming with familiarity of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.
