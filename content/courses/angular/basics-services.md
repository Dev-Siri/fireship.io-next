<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```text
ng g service clock
```

## Use-Cases for Services

Services can inject shared data and methods into your components. They are also useful for writing code that maintains a DRY separation of concerns.

- Shared state. Services can connect data between components and are especially useful when components are not in a child/parent relationship.
- Shared logic. Stateless services that define common methods used in multiple components.
