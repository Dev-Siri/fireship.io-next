JavaScript started as a prototype scripting language written by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator browser under the working name of "Mocha". After being renamed to "JavaScript", it was standardized by ECMA International as [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262-arch.htm), or ECMAScript in 1997. The authoritative group of people/orgs in charge of the standard is known as TC-39. 

Over the next 25 years, it would see a variety of highs and lows. The most notable releases include 

- ES1 1997.
- ES2 1998.
- ES3 1999. The longest standing version of early JS. 
- ES4 Never finalized. 
- ES5 2009. Added JSON, strict mode, functional array methods, and more. 
- ES6 2015. Added classes, promises, arrow functions, let/const, and much more.
- ES7, ES8, ES9, ESNext. Modern updates now being released annually.
