## Namespace packages

The easiest way to deal with name conflicts is to use a namespace package.

{{< file "dart" "packages.dart" >}}
```dart
import 'somewhere.dart' as External;
```

## Exclude code from a package

Exclude code from a package with the `hide` keyword.

{{< file "dart" "packages.dart" >}}
```dart
import 'somewhere.dart' hide Circle;
```

## Isolate code from a package

Import individual classes from a package with the `show` keyword.

{{< file "dart" "packages.dart" >}}
```dart
import 'somewhere.dart' show Rectangle;
```
