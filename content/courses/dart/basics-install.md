## How to Follow Along

I'd recommend that you code along with each video in your own editor. You can find the [full source code](https://github.com/fireship-io/dart-course) for each video on GitHub.

### Option 1 - Install Flutter

If you plan on using Flutter, follow the [Flutter installation instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/).

### Option 2 - Install Dart

If you don't care about Flutter, checkout the [Dart SDK Install guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### Option 3 - Use Dart Pad

If you want to use the browser, try [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/)
