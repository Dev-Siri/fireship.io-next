## How Merge Conflicts Happen

Merge conflicts happen when two commits affect the same line of code at the same time.

1. Feature branch modifies line 5 and commits.
2. Master branch modifies line 5 and commits.
3. Master branch tries to merge feature branch.

Here's how a merge conflict looks from the command line:

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```bash
git branch feature
# make some changes
git commit -am "awesome branch stuff"

git checkout master

# make some changes to same code

git commit -am "master branch stuff"

git merge feature

# CONFLICT!

````

## Explore a Merge Conflict

Use git diff to compare the changes in the feature branch and master branch.

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```bash
git diff
````

## Fix a Merge Conflict

The easiest way to fix the merge conflict is use the editor to choose between the incoming changes (feature) or the existing changes (master). Then create a new _merge_ commit with the changes you want to keep.

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```bash
# choose preferred code on master branch
git commit -am "resolved merge conflict"
```

If you're not sure, you can abort:

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```bash
git merge --abort
```
