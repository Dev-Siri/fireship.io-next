In order to build an app identical to the live demo, you need to populate Firestore with data. 

## Populate your Database with Quiz Data

I recommend cloning the [Quiz Questions Repo](https://github.com/fireship-io/fireship-quizapp-data). It is a node script that allows you to populate all the quiz data in your own database with a single command.

## Database Model

You can also create your own data from scratch. Below you will find screenshots of sample quiz data for each collection.
