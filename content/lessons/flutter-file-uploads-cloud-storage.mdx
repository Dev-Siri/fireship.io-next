Camera apps are one of the most popular niches in the market, with the recent viral growth of [FaceApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceApp) being a prime example. There are a variety of plugins for Flutter that make camera-based features easy to develop, and when combined with Firebase the results can be easily uploaded your backend cloud infrastructure. The following lesson demonstrates the following features:

1. Capture images from the device camera or image gallery. 
1. Crop, rotate, and resize an image file. 
1. Upload files to a [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) bucket and show a visual progress indicator.

## Initial Setup

Before starting this tutorial, you must have Firebase installed and configured in your app for iOS and Android. 

1. Install FlutterFire



### Dependencies

The Firebase packages required for file uploads include Core and [Storage](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_storage). You may also want to include Firestore and Auth if you plan on associating uploaded files to a user.  

{{< file "flutter" "pubspec.yaml" >}}
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  firebase_core: 0.4.0+8
  firebase_storage: 3.0.4

  image_cropper: 1.0.2
  image_picker: 0.6.0+17
```

In addition to Firebase Storage, this lesson depends on [image_cropper](https://pub.dev/packages/image_cropper) and [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker). Keep in mind, these packages are unrelated to file uploads, but are extremely useful when capturing user-generated images. Follow the install instructions on their official documentation for platform-specific iOS and Android requirements.


<File name="main.dart">
  <Dart />
</File>
```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_storage/firebase_storage.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:image_cropper/image_cropper.dart';
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';

void main() async {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ImageCapture(),
    );
  }
}
```



## Image Capture and Crop

The widget below is responsible for capturing an image file from the device, either via the camera or the photo gallery. Once a file is selected, a preview will be shown in the UI and the user can crop, resize, or rotate the raw Dart *File*. The *image_cropper* plugin does all the heavy lifting for the image manipulation, so we gain a ton of functionality with minimal code. 

### Image Capture Widget

Both `_pickImage` and `_cropImage` are async methods that update the state of the widget with an image file. If the image is defined, the app displays a visual preview with the *Image* widget and provides buttons to crop or clear it. 

Notice how the file is being passed down to *Uploader*. This is a custom widget defined in the next section to manage the file upload task. 


<File name="main.dart">
  <Dart />
</File>
```dart
/// Widget to capture and crop the image
class ImageCapture extends StatefulWidget {
  createState() => _ImageCaptureState();
}

class _ImageCaptureState extends State<ImageCapture> {
  /// Active image file
  File _imageFile;

  /// Cropper plugin
  Future<void> _cropImage() async {
    File cropped = await ImageCropper.cropImage(
        sourcePath: _imageFile.path,
        // ratioX: 1.0,
        // ratioY: 1.0,
        // maxWidth: 512,
        // maxHeight: 512,
        toolbarColor: Colors.purple,
        toolbarWidgetColor: Colors.white,
        toolbarTitle: 'Crop It'
      );

    setState(() {
      _imageFile = cropped ?? _imageFile;
    });
  }

  /// Select an image via gallery or camera
  Future<void> _pickImage(ImageSource source) async {
    File selected = await ImagePicker.pickImage(source: source);

    setState(() {
      _imageFile = selected;
    });
  }

  /// Remove image
  void _clear() {
    setState(() => _imageFile = null);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(

      // Select an image from the camera or gallery
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomAppBar(
        child: Row(
          children: <Widget>[
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.photo_camera),
              onPressed: () => _pickImage(ImageSource.camera),
            ),
            IconButton(
              icon: Icon(Icons.photo_library),
              onPressed: () => _pickImage(ImageSource.gallery),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),

      // Preview the image and crop it
      body: ListView(
        children: <Widget>[
          if (_imageFile != null) ...[

            Image.file(_imageFile),

            Row(
              children: <Widget>[
                FlatButton(
                  child: Icon(Icons.crop),
                  onPressed: _cropImage,
                ),
                FlatButton(
                  child: Icon(Icons.refresh),
                  onPressed: _clear,
                ),
              ],
            ),

            Uploader(file: _imageFile)
          ]
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Upload to Firebase Storage

In this section, the [File](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.4.0/dart-io/File-class.html) object will be uploaded to a Firebase Cloud Storage bucket. The user can pause or cancel the upload task at any point, which is a useful feature when handling large files and/or users on slow networks. In addition, the widget monitors the upload progress and displays the percentage of bytes transferred using the [LinearProgressIndicator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/LinearProgressIndicator-class.html). 

### Uploader Widget

When you create a *StorageUploadTask* it will immediately start uploading the file to storage. The task exposes a stream that emits a *StorageTaskEvent* containing metadata about the upload, such as bytes-transferred, which can be used to calculate the value of a progress indicator. 

You can also obtain the current state of the upload with boolean `task.isComplete` or `task.isInProgress` and so on. 

<File name="main.dart">
  <Dart />
</File>
```dart
class _UploaderState extends State<Uploader> {
  final FirebaseStorage _storage =
      FirebaseStorage(storageBucket: 'gs://fireship-lessons.appspot.com');

  StorageUploadTask _uploadTask;

  /// Starts an upload task
  void _startUpload() {

    /// Unique file name for the file
    String filePath = 'images/${DateTime.now()}.png';

    setState(() {
      _uploadTask = _storage.ref().child(filePath).putFile(widget.file);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_uploadTask != null) {

      /// Manage the task state and event subscription with a StreamBuilder
      return StreamBuilder<StorageTaskEvent>(
          stream: _uploadTask.events,
          builder: (_, snapshot) {
            var event = snapshot?.data?.snapshot;

            double progressPercent = event != null
                ? event.bytesTransferred / event.totalByteCount
                : 0;

            return Column(

                children: [
                  if (_uploadTask.isComplete)
                    Text('ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰'),


                  if (_uploadTask.isPaused)
                    FlatButton(
                      child: Icon(Icons.play_arrow),
                      onPressed: _uploadTask.resume,
                    ),

                  if (_uploadTask.isInProgress)
                    FlatButton(
                      child: Icon(Icons.pause),
                      onPressed: _uploadTask.pause,
                    ),

                  // Progress bar
                  LinearProgressIndicator(value: progressPercent),
                  Text(
                    '${(progressPercent * 100).toStringAsFixed(2)} % '
                  ),
                ],
              );
          });

          
    } else {

      // Allows user to decide when to start the upload
      return FlatButton.icon(
          label: Text('Upload to Firebase'),
          icon: Icon(Icons.cloud_upload),
          onPressed: _startUpload,
        );

    }
  }
}
```

### Bonus Video


In certain cases, you may want to convert an image to multiple formats after uploading. Watch the video below for a fill demo of this feature with Firebase Cloud Functions.
