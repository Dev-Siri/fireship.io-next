[FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) is a next-generation cloud database that combines the simplicity of NoSQL, without sacrificing the ability to model complex relationships. It's completely serverless, fast, ACID-compliant, and has a generous free tier for small apps - basically everything you could possibly want in a fully-managed database.

The following lesson demonstrates how to model a basic twitter-inspired social graph with FaunaDB and access it on the web with Node.js. It will introduce you to [Fauna Query Language](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/cheat_sheet) (FQL) and common patterns for reading and writing to the database.

## Initial Setup

Start by creating a node project, then install the [FaunaDB JS](https://github.com/fauna/faunadb-js) package and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```bash
npm init -y

npm install faunadb express

````

### Initialize FaunaDB

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/fauna-key.png" caption="Create a server key from the Fauna security tab" >}}

Initialize the client with your server key, then import the FQL functions required for this demo.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>
```javascript
const faunadb = require('faunadb');
const client = new faunadb.Client({ secret: 'YOUR-KEY' })

// FQL functions
const {
    Ref,
    Paginate,
    Get,
    Match,
    Select,
    Index,
    Create,
    Collection,
    Join,
    Call,
    Function: Fn,
} = faunadb.query;

````

### Initialize Express

We'll use Express to serve the API.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
const app = require("express")();

app.listen(5000, () => console.log("API on http://localhost:5000"));
```

At this point, I would recommend using an API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make requests to your API on http://localhost:5000.

### Database Structure

The database contains three collections - `users`, `tweets`, and `relationships`. Create these collections from the Fauna dashboard.

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/fauna-collections.png" caption="" >}}

## Users and Tweets

In the following section, we will create a variety of API endpoints for reading and writing tweets to Fauna. A user _has many_ tweets, a tweet _belongs to_ a user.

### Create a Tweet

First, go to the Fauna dashboard, and create a document with the name of `fireship_dev`. Our goal is to associate many tweets to this user account.

Next, create an index to search for a user based on the username.

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/fauna-index.png" caption="" >}}

A one-to-many relationship can be established by retrieving the user document `Ref`, then using it as the data with the `Create` function.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
app.post("/tweet", async (req, res) => {
  const data = {
    user: Select("ref", Get(Match(Index("users_by_name"), "fireship_dev"))),
    text: "Hello world!",
  };

  const doc = await client.query(Create(Collection("tweets"), { data }));

  res.send(doc);
});
```

### Read a Tweet by ID

Reading a document by its ID does not require an index. Use `Get` to read a single document by pointing to its collection and reference ID.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
app.get("/tweet/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const doc = await client.query(Get(Ref(Collection("tweets"), req.params.id)));

  res.send(doc);
});
```

### Query a User's Tweets

Reading multiple tweet documents by the user attribute requires an index. Create an index named `tweets_by_user` with a search term of `user`.

The `Paginate` function will return all documents that match the query.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
app.get("/tweet", async (req, res) => {
  const docs = await client.query(Paginate(Match(Index("tweets_by_user"), Select("ref", Get(Match(Index("users_by_name"), "fireship_dev"))))));

  res.send(docs);
});
```

## Fauna Functions

The code presented above duplicates the following line of FQL several times:

```javascript
Select("ref", Get(Match(Index("users_by_name"), "fireship_dev")));
```

Fauna [Functions](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/functions) provide a way to extract this logic to the cloud to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

### Create a Function

Extract the duplicated code to a function from the Fauna dashboard. The function accepts the username string as an argument and returns the full user document reference.

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/fauna-function.png" caption="" >}}

### Call a Function

Use `Call` to execute this function in a query. For example, we can refactor the previous example like so:

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
const { Call, Function: Fn } = faunadb.query;

app.get("/tweet", async (req, res) => {
  const docs = await client.query(Paginate(Match(Index("tweets_by_user"), Call(Fn("getUser"), "fireship_dev"))));

  res.send(docs);
});
```

## User-to-User Relationships

The following section models a social graph where users can follow other users, then query a feed of their tweets.

### Create a Relationship

A relationship document contains two user references - the follower and followee.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
app.post("/relationship", async (req, res) => {
  const data = {
    follower: Call(Fn("getUser"), "bob"),
    followee: Call(Fn("getUser"), "fireship_dev"),
  };
  const doc = await client.query(Create(Collection("relationships"), { data }));

  res.send(doc);
});
```

### Query a Feed of Tweets

After establishing a relationship, you likely want to query tweets from followed users - this will require a `Join`.

Create an index named `followees_by_follower` with a search term of `followee` and a value of `follower`.

The `Paginate` function will return all followed users, then Join will match the user references to the `tweets_by_user` index.

<File name="src/index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```javascript
app.get("/feed", async (req, res) => {
  const docs = await client.query(Paginate(Join(Match(Index("followees_by_follower"), Call(Fn("getUser"), "bob")), Index("tweets_by_user"))));

  res.send(docs);
});
```
