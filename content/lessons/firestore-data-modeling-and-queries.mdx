[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries) recently came out of beta and can now be used in production with full confidence. Still, the greatest challenge for any app using a NoSQL database almost always comes down to **data modeling**. Firestore gives you a ton of flexibility, but that means you have more decisions to consider. 

The following lesson will take you through a variety of practical examples of data modeling and querying on Firestore. 




This post first appeared as [Episode 85 on AngularFirebase.com](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/firestore-nosql-data-modeling-by-example/) and has been fully updated for Firestore v1. 


## Key Concepts

Here are few key principles to follow when using Firestore.

- Let your frontend design drive decisions about data modeling. 
- Collections can be infinitely large, while documents less than 1Mb
- Data duplication is OK

### Types of Queries

Below are examples of the types of queries you can make in Firestore. They can be chained together to build complex compound queries. 

<File name="query.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>
```js
// Single Document Read 
const doc = ref.doc(path);

// Full Collection Read
const col = ref.collection(path);

// Ordered Collection
col.orderBy(field, 'asc')

// Limited Collection
col.limit(10);

// Paginated Collection, startAt endAt endAfter endBefore
col.orderBy(field, 'asc').startAt(offset).limit(10);

// Where, an expressive query
col.where(field, '>=', value)
```

**Pro Tip âš¡** You can build queries directly from the Firebase Console and it will generate the necessary code for you.

## Has-One or Belongs-To Relationship

One of the most common data relationships you will encounter is when an entity **has one** item. Or in other words, an item **belongs-to** the entity. If you're using Firebase Auth, you can model ownership giving a document the same ID as the user. 

Example: A user has one account. An account belongs to a user. 


### Database Structure

Notice how both documents share the same unique ID. This allows you to associate and join multiple documents to a single user/entity.

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/firestore-belongs-to.png" alt="A belongs-to relationship in Firestore" >}}

### Query

Now we can query the related data with a basic document read. First, make a reference to the document path, then decide how you want to consume the data. 

<File name="fire.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>
```js
const db = firebase.firestore();

const uid = 'userXYZ';

// 1. Make a reference
const userRef = db.collection('users').doc(uid);
const acctRef = db.doc(`accounts/${uid}`);

// 2a. single read
userRef.get().then(snapshot => doStuff);

// 2b. or setup a realtime listener
acctRef.onSnapshot(snapshot => doStuff);
```


## Has-Many Relationship - Embedded

It is also possible for an entity to **have-many** of a certain item. 

Example: A user has many tasks


### Database Structure

{{< figure src="/img/content/snippets/firestore-has-one.png" alt="A has one relationship in Firestore" >}}

### Query

## Has-Many




- Has one, belongs to
- Has many
- Many to many, via embedded array/map
- Many to many, via connecting col



## Recipes

Jason baisden So man...thought I was getting the hang of Cloud Firestore. I have an object, LearningNote. Each LearningNote correlates to a goal. I've set this up in my code such that LearningNote has a property of type Goal. So now my LearningNote service is querying my Goal service for each object returned. In Firestore, LearningNote and Goals are their own collections. Any thoughts on how to tidy this up? Is this the "right" way to do it? I've thought about making LearningNotes a child collection of Goals, but am still wondering how I'd get the goal information for each learning note.

alterNerDive hey pro-members, what is the better solution:
I have 1 collection with articles, articles-doc has a field `type` and could have value A or B.
On one site, i load this collection and build 2 lists, 1 for `type===A` and 1 for `type===B`.

What is the better solution:
Load whole collection and filter on template with `*ngIf="article.type===A"` or load data 2 times with filter in query?


Anyone have a firestore solution for indexes and tagging when you're querying with tags (setup as based boolean maps) and ordering by something like updatedAt?  I have a collection of documents that can have any number of topic based tags.  I can query documents that match multiple tags until I try and order the documents and then Firebase wants to create a index for each tag (which is not viable).  Any suggestions much appreciated.
