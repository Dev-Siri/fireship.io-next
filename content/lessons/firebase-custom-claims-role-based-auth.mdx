Firebase allows developers to modify authentication [ID tokens](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/verify-id-tokens) to provide fine-grained system access to authorized users. The follow lesson adds [custom claims](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to the Firebase user record to build a [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) feature that is secured with Firestore rules.

## Set Custom Claims from the Command Line

It is not possible (currently) to add custom claims from the Firebase Console. This means we need to write some code with [Firebase Admin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).

In the real world, you will most likely update custom claims from a [Cloud Function](https://fireship.io/courses/cloud-functions/). For example, the user makes a purchase and you update their claim as a _paid_ user.

### Initial Setup

Th easiest way to update custom claims is to write a simple Node.js script. If starting from scratch, run the commands below in an empty directory.

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```text
npm init -y
npm i firebase-admin
touch index.js
```

### Service Account

Download your [service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk) from the Firebase settings tab and save it as `service-account.json` in the project directory. ‚ö†Ô∏è The service account contains sensitive API keys that should not be exposed publicly.

### Update Claims with Firebase Auth

The script below calls the `auth.setCustomUserClaims` method to add a claims object to the user's ID token. You can save any data to the claims object as long as it can be serialized to JSON.

The max size of the claims object is 1000 bytes. It is a good practice to only save the bare minimum amount of data required for authorization logic.

<File name="index.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```js
const admin = require("firebase-admin");
admin.initializeApp();

const auth = admin.auth();

const uid = "NUc3KyG2RAfNuOrE0pzMMZegFHS2";

const customClaims = {
  roles: ["creator", "auditor", "admin"],
};

(async () => {
  await auth.setCustomUserClaims(uid, customClaims);
  const user = await auth.getUser(uid);
  console.log("success", user);
  process.exit();
})();
```

Run the script from the command line making sure to set an environment variable that points to the service account.

<File name="command line">
  <Terminal />
</File>
```text
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=service-account.json 
node index.js
```

Now that we have a way to update claims, let's looks at a few common use cases.

## Simple Admin Levels

### Use Case

The most basic type of access control is to distinguish between a boolean value, such as paid/unpaid users or admins/non-admins. You might also fine tune access levels by also setting an integer value.

```js
const customClaims = {
  admin: true,
  level: 7,
};
```

### Firestore Rules

The Firestore rules grant read access to all admins, but limit write access to admins above level 5.

{{< file "firebase" "firebase.rules" >}}

```js
    match /{path=**}/secrets/{id} {
      allow read: if request.auth.token.admin;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.level > 5;
    }
```

## Role-based Access Control

### Use Case

A very common requirement is role-based authorization. A user can be assigned a list of roles, which determine if that user can perform a certain action. This strategy is common is CMS platforms - Wordpress for example has roles like _super_admin_, _admin_, _editor_, _author_, and so on.

```js
const customClaims = {
  roles: ["creator", "auditor", "admin"],
};
```

### Firestore Rules

We can assume a user with any role has read access, so checking by length is sufficient. For write access, we allow the `admin` to perform all actions, but limit the `creator` and `auditor` roles to specific types of writes.

{{< file "firebase" "firebase.rules" >}}

```js
match /{path=**}/secrets/{id} {
    allow read: if request.auth.token.roles.size > 0;
    allow create: if request.auth.token.roles.hasAny(['creator', 'admin']);
    allow update: if request.auth.token.roles.hasAny(['auditor', 'admin']);
    allow delete: if request.auth.token.roles.hasAny(['admin']);
}
```

Tip: You could make the code above more concise my extracting the logic into a rules function.

```js
match /{path=**}/secrets/{id} {
    allow create: if userHasRole(['creator', 'admin']);
    allow update: if userHasRole(['auditor', 'admin']);
    allow delete: if userHasRole(['admin']);
}


function userHasRole(roles) {
    return request.auth.token.roles.hasAny(roles);
}
```

## Access Control List

### Use Case

Imagine an app where **users can belong to multiple organizations AND have customized access assigned for each organization**. For example, each company may want to limit access to a specific department.

An access control list (ACL) is the opposite of role-based auth. Rather than give the user sweeping access to a path, the ID of the resource determines if access can be granted to that user.

```js
const customClaims = {
  orgs: {
    uber: ["accounting", "finance"],
    tesla: ["manufacturing", "ai"],
    mcdonalds: ["nuggets"],
  },
};
```

### Firestore Rules

The rule below matches the document ID to the user's custom claims. For example a read to `orgs/tesla/departments/manufacturing` would be allowed in this example.

{{< file "firebase" "firebase.rules" >}}

```js
    match /{path=**}/orgs/{orgId}/departments/{departmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.token.orgs[orgId].hasAny([departmentId])
    }
```

## Validate Claims from the Frontend

### Retrieve the ID Token

Custom claims can also be used to build the frontend UI. Get the result of the ID token like so:

<File name="app.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```js
const token = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();

if (token.claims.admin) {
  // show admin UI
}
```

### Force Refresh of the ID Token

The ID token will refresh every 1 hour, or you can force it to refresh manually to propagate changes to the custom claims.

<File name="app.js">
  <JavaScript />
</File>

```js
firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult(true);
```
