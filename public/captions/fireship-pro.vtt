00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Fireship PRO

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
learn web and mobile development with highly focused short videos

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.000
for both beginners and experienced software engineers.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Learning to code can open doors like no other skill can.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
You might use it to build a billion dollar business,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
land a six figure job without a degree,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
or have fun understanding how our technology works under the hood.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm Jeff, and I have been a professional developer for over 10 years

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
and you probably already know me from Youtube.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.200
I make my own brand of fast-paced content that distiles important concepts

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
into as few words as possible.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.299
A 5 minute fireship video can cover as much

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.399
as an hour of content in most traditional courses.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.999
Why do I teach this way?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
Well, human beings learn to code by building projects and having fun doing it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
Kids don't learn to build legos by watching videos,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
they learn through play,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
and programming is no different.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Many beginners end up in a place called 'tutorial hell',

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.100
where you go from video to video but never really learn anything.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000
On Fireship, short videos are carefully produced

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.200
to infuse with the knowledge required to start experimenting and having fun with code.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.500
As a pro member, you will have access to full courses which are a complete path to learning a new tech stack.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400
They are project based, and followed in a linear format.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.999
Each video also contains some code and encourages you to build your own projects

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.999
side by side as we go through the course.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.700
Courses start at easy and get increasingly difficult as you make progress.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.000
In addition, members have access to pro lessons

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.100
which are very similar to my style on Youtube but much more advanced and specialized.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.500
If you get stuck at any point, you can reach out on our slack community with over 10k members

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.800
for chat support, 7 days a week.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900
I also do private 101 meetings with members when time allows

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and occasionally larger and via only group meetings.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and finally, every new member is mailed a sticker and lifetime members get a free t-shirt.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.500
This has been Fireship PRO in 100 seconds.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.400
Thanks for watching

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.000
and I look forward to helping you build and ship your app faster.
